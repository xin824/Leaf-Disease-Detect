Installing
----------

Full install (recommended):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We've created an easy installation script that will install all
pre-requisites and get your Pan-Tilt HAT up and running with minimal
efforts. To run it, fire up Terminal which you'll find in Menu ->
Accessories -> Terminal on your Raspberry Pi desktop, as illustrated
below:

.. figure:: http://get.pimoroni.com/resources/github-repo-terminal.png

   Finding the terminal

In the new terminal window type the command exactly as it appears below
(check for typos) and follow the on-screen instructions:

.. code:: bash

    curl https://get.pimoroni.com/gfxhat | bash

If you choose to download examples you'll find them in
``/home/pi/Pimoroni/gfxhat/``.

Development:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to contribute, or like living on the edge of your seat by
having the latest code, you should clone this repository, ``cd`` to the
library directory, and run:

.. code:: bash

    sudo python3 setup.py install

(or ``sudo python setup.py install`` whichever your primary Python
environment may be)

In all cases you will have to enable the i2c and spi buses.
